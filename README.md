2.7 User Account Management
The system should allow users to manage their account information such as name, email, and address. Users should be able to update their profile information and view their purchase history.

3.Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance
The system should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and high volumes of data. The response time for user interactions should be fast, and the system should be scalable to accommodate increasing user traffic.
3.2 Security
The system should ensure the security of user data and prevent unauthorized access. The system should use encryption for sensitive data such as passwords and should implement security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

3.3 Usability
The system should be user-friendly and easy to use. The user interface should be intuitive and responsive, and the system should provide clear instructions for user interactions.

3.4 Compatibility
The system should be compatible with different web browsers and operating systems. The system should be tested on popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

4.Constraints
4.1 Technology
The system should be developed using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The system should also use a robust backend technology such as Node.js or Ruby on Rails.
4.2 Budget
The system should be developed within a specified budget. The development cost should include the cost of hardware, software, and development effort.

5.Assumptions and Dependencies
5.1 Assumptions
The system assumes that users have access to a reliable internet connection and a web browser. The system also assumes that users have a basic understanding of how to use e-commerce applications.
5.2 Dependencies
The system depends on the availability and reliability of the payment gateway for online transactions. The system also depends on the availability and reliability of third-party services such as shipping and delivery services.

Conclusion
This document has outlined the functional and non-functional requirements for an e-commerce application. The system should be designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly. The development should be within the specified budget and should use modern web technologies. The system should be tested thoroughly to
